Title: Risk Measure Calculation in Financial TS
Version: 1.0.0
Description: Enables the user to calculate Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected 
    Shortfall (ES) by means of various parametric and semiparametric 
    GARCH-type models. For the latter the estimation of the nonparametric scale
    function is carried out by means of a data-driven smoothing approach. Model
    quality, in terms of forecasting VaR and ES, can be assessed by means of 
    various backtesting methods such as the traffic light test for VaR and a 
    newly developed traffic light test for ES. The approaches implemented in 
    this package are described in e.g. Feng Y., Beran J., Letmathe S. and 
    Ghosh S. <https://ideas.repec.org/p/pdn/ciepap/137.html> as well as 
    Letmathe S., Feng Y. and Uhde A. (2021)
