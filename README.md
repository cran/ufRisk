The goal of `ufRisk` is to enable the user to compute one-step ahead
forecasts of Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) by means of
various parametric and semiparametric GARCH-type models. For the latter
the estimation of the nonparametric scale function is carried out by
means of a data-driven smoothing approach. Currently the GARCH, the
exponential GARCH (EGARCH), the Log-GARCH, the asymmetric power ARCH
(APARCH), the FIGARCH and FI-Log-GARCH can be employed within the scope
of `ufRisk`. Model quality, in terms of forecasting VaR and ES, can be
assessed by means of various backtesting methods.

## Installation

You can install the released version of ufRisk from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("ufRisk")
```

## Example

The data set `ESTX`, which is implemented in the `ufRisk` package,
contains daily financial data of the EURO STOXX 50 (ESTX) index from
April 2007 to December 2021. In the following an example of the
(out-of-sample) one-step forecasts of the
97.5![\\%](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;%5C%25 "\%")-VaR
(red line) and the corresponding ES (green line) as well as the
99![\\%](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;%5C%25 "\%")-VaR
(green line), which are obtained by employing a FIGARCH model to the
`ESTX` return series, are illustrated. Exceedances are indicated by the
colored circles.

``` r
# Applying the FIGARCH model to the ESTX return series
x = ESTX$price.close
results = varcast(x, model = 'fiGARCH', a.v = 0.99, a.e = 0.975, n.out = 250)
```

**Visualize your results by means of the implemented plot method**

Plotting the out-of-sample loss series:

``` r
plot(results, plot.option = 1)
```

Plotting the out-of-sample loss series, VaR.v & breaches:

``` r
plot(results, plot.option = 2) 
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="100%" />

Plotting the out-of-sample loss series, VaR.e, ES & breaches:

``` r
plot(results, plot.option = 3) 
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="100%" />

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Assess the quality of your model by employing various backtesting
methods by means of the functions `trafftest`, `covtest` and `lossfunc`.

**Conduct a traffic light test for VaR and ES**

``` r
trafftest(results)
#>  
#> ###################################
#> #       Backtesting results       #
#> ###################################
#>  
#> # Traffic light zone boundaries #
#>  Zone         Probability      
#>  Green zone:  p < 95%          
#>  Yellow zone: 95% <= p < 99.99%
#>  Red zone:    p >= 99.99%      
#>  
#> # Test 1: 99%-VaR #
#>  Number of violations: 4
#>  p = 0.8922: Green zone
#>  
#> # Test 2: 97.5%-VaR #
#>  Number of violations: 9
#>  p = 0.9005: Green zone
#>  
#> # Test 3: 97.5%-ES #
#>  Number of weighted violations: 5.1227
#>  p = 0.9188: Green zone
#>  
#> # Weighted Absolute Deviation #
#>  WAD = 1.6793
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Conduct a conditional and unconditional coverage test as well as an
independence test**

``` r
covtest(results)
#>  
#> ##################################
#> #          Test results          #
#> ##################################
#>  
#> # Unconditional coverage test #
#>  
#> H0: w = 0.99
#> p_[uc] = 0.3805
#> Decision: Fail to reject H0
#>  
#> # Independence test #
#>  
#> H0: w_[00] = w_[10]
#> p_[ind] = 0.6865
#> Decision: Fail to reject H0
#>  
#> # Conditional coverage test #
#>  
#> H0: w_[00] = w_[10] = 0.99
#> p_[cc] = 0.6275
#> Decision: Fail to reject H0
#> 
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Calculate different loss functions**

``` r
lossfunc(results)
#> Please note that the following results are multiplied with 10000.
#> 
#> $lossfunc1
#> [1] 7.693316
#> 
#> $lossfunc2
#> [1] 14.31244
#> 
#> $lossfunc3
#> [1] 14.56085
#> 
#> $lossfunc4
#> [1] 13.61529
```
